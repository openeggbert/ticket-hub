# Verification record

Verified in the provided Linux environment with GCC 14.2.0, SQLite 3.46.1 and libpq 17.9.

## Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-core \
  -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF \
  -DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=ON \
  -DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=ON
cmake --build build-core --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

## Passing tests

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`
   - project key normalization and 2–12-character validation,
   - issue-key normalization and validation,
   - label normalization,
   - issue-create validation.

2. `ticket-hub-migration-tests`
   - ordered discovery,
   - exclusion of demo seed files,
   - stable content checksums.

3. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests`
   - ordered migration application and idempotence,
   - idempotent demo seed,
   - two projects returned exactly once,
   - eight seeded issues,
   - transactional creation of `TH-7`,
   - labels and detail readback,
   - permanent old-key alias resolution,
   - optimistic status update and version increment,
   - rejection of a stale update,
   - comment creation/listing,
   - dashboard counts and ordering,
   - rejection of a historical migration modified after application.

## Additional static validation

- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters compile and link into `ticket-hub-core`.
- `ticket-hub-cli` compiles, reports version 0.2.0 and applies the schema to a fresh SQLite database.
- SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only configurations both compile; all tests available in each configuration pass.
- Frontend JavaScript is checked with Node syntax validation when Node is available.

## Environment limitations

- A PostgreSQL server was not available for a live adapter integration test.
- Full Crow server configuration was attempted but could not fetch Crow because the sandbox could not resolve GitHub and no installed Crow package was available. The HTTP-layer source changes therefore were not compiled in this environment.
