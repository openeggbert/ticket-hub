# Changelog

## Unreleased — Phase 1: identity and sessions (reduced scope)

- Re-reviewed all 142 original product decisions with the product owner and produced a reduced V1
  scope (`REDUCED_SCOPE_SPECIFICATION.md` and friends); this is now the build target instead of the
  original full-scope plan.
- Added local-account identity: `Principal`, Argon2id password hashing (`common/PasswordHash`), SHA-256
  session-token hashing (`common/Sha256`), and `AuthService` (login/logout/session validation,
  administrator-only account creation, minimal login-attempt lockout).
- Added migration `004_identity.sql` (both backends): `local_credentials`, `sessions`, and `users` gains
  `time_zone`/`clock_format`/`is_admin` while losing the prototype's `username` column. The SQLite
  variant rebuilds the `users` table (SQLite cannot `DROP COLUMN` a column in a `UNIQUE` constraint
  directly); `SqliteDatabase::migrate()` now disables and re-verifies foreign keys around every
  migration to support this and future table-rebuild migrations safely.
- Removed the fixed `demo` user from every write path. `TicketService::createIssue`/`changeStatus`/
  `addComment` now require an explicit `Domain::Principal` argument.
- Added `ticket-hub-cli create-user <email> <displayName> <password> [--admin]` — the entire V1
  registration/reset story (no public registration, no invitations, no forced password change).
- `CreateIssueRequest::assigneeUsername` renamed to `assigneeEmail` (assignee lookup is now by email,
  not the removed username column); updated in `web/index.html` and `web/app.js` accordingly.
- Added `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`, and session-cookie + double-submit-CSRF
  protection to the existing write routes in `src/web/Api.cpp` (**not yet compiled** — see
  "Known verification limitation" in `README.md`).
- Added `crypto_tests` (SHA-256 known-answer vectors, Argon2id round-trip) and
  `identity_integration_tests` (SQLite: create-user, login success/failure, anti-enumeration, lockout,
  session lifecycle) test binaries; all previously-passing tests continue to pass.
- Manually verified migrations, seeding, `create-user`, and a full login/session/logout cycle against a
  live local PostgreSQL 16 server, in addition to the automated SQLite test suite.
